It was a night like stormy and wild. You wouldn’t believe it, but this quiet little town has its dark secrets.
It was 30 years ago, and I was just a boy, barely older than you lot. Back then, we had a neighborhood troublemaker, a boy
 named Ravindra Bisai. Ravindra wasn’t just any troublemaker—he had a knack for being where he shouldn’t be. That night, he 
decided to sneak into the old Rajdudth mansion, abandoned and rumored to be haunted. I remember watching from my window as 
the rain poured down and lightning flashed, seeing him slip through the gate. Ravindra always thought he was invincible.
But that was the last time anyone saw him alive.
